# Debrief

## What is it?

**Debrief is an easy to use note-taking application crossed with a diary.**

**A WORD OF CAUTION** : Debrief is still under heavy development at the moment and some core things may (and probably will) change. I still need to work toward a really stable release.

### Features:

- **Open-source project** ;
- **Multi-users**, your notes can be **shared** with others ;
- Notes can be **commented** ;
- **Markdown** enabled ;
- **File uploads** are handled with drag'n'drop ;
- **Create links** between stories, diary pages, people … with autocompletion.

… And much more !
